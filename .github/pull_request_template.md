**What does this pull request add, improve or fixes?**

If the feature request or bug is already documented in an issue you can just link the issue.

**Can you explain why this improvement or fix may be useful?**

Same as before, if it was already discussed in an issue the link is sufficient.

**If you changed the code, have you added enough unit tests?**

Please note that this project impose 100% code coverage. If you add code "someone" will have to add the corresponding unit tests
to reach that 100% goal. That may or may not be you, but if you provide unit test for your feature it will probably be merged faster.
